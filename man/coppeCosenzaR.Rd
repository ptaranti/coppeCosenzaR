COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model (coppeCosenzaR).

The program implements the COPPE-Cosenza Fuzzy Hierarchy Model .

The model was based on the evaluation of local alternatives, representing
regional potentialities, so as to fulfill demands of economic projects.
After defining demand profiles in terms of their technological coefficients,
the degree of importance of factors is defined so as to represent
the productive activity.

The method can detect a surplus of supply without the restriction of the
distance of classical algebra, defining an hierarchy of location
alternatives. In Coppe-Cosenza Model, the distance between factors
is measured in terms of the difference between grades of  memberships of the
same factors belonging to two or more  sets under comparison.

The required factors are classified under the following linguistic variables:
\itemize{
\item Critical (CR),
\item Contitioning (C),
\item Little Conditioning (LC), and
\item Irrelevant (I).
}

And the alternatives can assume the following linguistic variables:
\itemize{
\item Excellent (Ex),
\item Good (G),
\item Regular (R),
\item Weak (W),
\item Empty (Em),
\item Zero (Z), and
\item Inexistent (In).
}

The model also provides flexibility, allowing different aggregation rules to
be performed and defined by the Decision Maker. Such feature is considered
in this package, allowing the user to define other aggregation matrices,
since it considers the same linguistic variables mentioned.
